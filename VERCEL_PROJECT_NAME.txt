To get exactly: https://supply-chain-simulator.vercel.app

During Vercel setup:

1. In "Configure Project" step
2. Project Name field: supply-chain-simulator
3. This gives you: supply-chain-simulator.vercel.app

⚠️ NOTE: If "supply-chain-simulator" is taken by another user:
- Vercel will add a random suffix: supply-chain-simulator-abc123.vercel.app
- You can then add a custom domain later (free on any plan)

Custom Domain Options (if name is taken):
- supply-chain-sim.vercel.app
- sc-simulator.vercel.app  
- scsim.vercel.app
- Or buy your own domain (e.g., mysupplychain.com)

To check availability, you can try deploying - Vercel will tell you immediately if the name is available.
